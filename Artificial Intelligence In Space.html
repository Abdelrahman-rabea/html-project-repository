        This week two world's collide: it's World Space Week and World AI Week!! So what better time to write a dedicated Space to Explore article on Artificial Intelligence for Space Exploration!

The potential for Artificial Intelligence (AI) to augment current and future space exploration is huge. There are a number of applications of AI that could drastically improve the future of space exploration missions, from greater planetary navigation and optimised mission operations, to analysing astronaut biometric data and enhancing knowledge discovery.

AI will vastly transform robotics from its existing state of operating within known and static environments, to a new “intelligent” breed, able to move fast, with greater autonomy and an ability to generalise to unforeseen environments and circumstances. Advanced manipulation is an important benchmark of space robotics in order to carry out emerging space exploration applications such as resource utilisation and infrastructure building.

This article aims to provide a broad analysis of the possibilities for using AI to augment space exploration and enable our long-term goal of humans on the surface of Mars.

        TAI provides a series of techniques that enable systems to mimic some form of intelligence to complete tasks, such as performing data analysis or driving cars. Through AI, machines can respond to the sensory data they gather and make decisions on their own, allowing them to adapt to their environments and situations. This has a major potential benefit in that these signals do not have to be anticipated, and the systems don’t have to be controlled, by humans.

        AI is often confused with any technology that performs tasks faster than the human brain in a robust manner. A calculator can perform complex mathematical equations at speed, but does that make it intelligent? Not in this context. Intelligence can be thought of as the ability of machines (agents) to perceive and recognise their environment, to be able to learn from past experiences, and logically make decisions based on new scenarios (usually whilst working towards a goal). Much like human intelligence, Artificial Intelligence consists of a spectrum of capabilities: a scale of speed, autonomy, and ability to generalise well to unseen situations that combine to create performance. 
        
        The fastest growing branch of AI is machine learning (ML) whereby AI models learn by themselves, in essence by training a relatively simple algorithm to become increasingly complex. A variety of ‘unstructured’ data forms, including images, spoken language, and the internet are used to carry out a range of activities from informing medical diagnoses, to creating recommender systems for the entertainment industry; from making investment decisions for financial companies, to helping driverless cars read highway signs. ML models process information in a similar way to humans by developing artificial neural networks (ANN or simply NN). The system progressively improves its performance on a specific task by “learning” from its environment, without being explicitly programmed.
        
        Within machine learning, a promising and advanced technique is maturing known as deep learning (DL), whereby the AI model, using multi-layered artificial neural networks, is able to train itself to perform complex tasks, such as image recognition. There are two main classifications of DL algorithms: supervised learning, where, for example, you feed the model pictures of celestial bodies until it can identify different types, or unsupervised learning where, the network finds the structure and writes the rules by itself, for example navigation systems for self-flying spacecraft.
